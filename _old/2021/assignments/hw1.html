                <p>Welcome to the team! To start your journey on this project, your first task is to become familiar
                    with an existing piece of software. Eventually you will be adding new features, but the first step
                    is to simply download, run, evaluate, and explore the current software product. The project we will
                    be building on this semester is an open source document management system, the Mayan EDMS (<a
                        href="https://www.mayan-edms.com/">https://www.mayan-edms.com/</a>) system.</p>
                <p>We will be using a class-specific fork of Mayan, whose repository is located at: <a
                        href="https://github.com/CMU-313/Mayan-EDMS">https://github.com/CMU-313/Mayan-EDMS</a>. This
                    fork is based off <a href="https://docs.mayan-edms.com/releases/4.0.7.html">v4.0.7</a> (released
                    June 11, 2021), and contains minor tweaks to make it easier to modify and debug. Forking from this
                    repository will also allow you to send pull requests to the instructors, which is the primary way of
                    submitting code deliverables.</p>
                <p>Your first step should be to read the documentation from Mayan EDMS, and review the contents of the
                    repository. There is documentation both for users, and for developers.</p>
                <p>Your next task is to simply download and run the system. There are several ways to do this, but we
                    strongly suggest that you build a Docker container. While you may install locally, that is almost
                    always significantly more work then using Docker. The documentation for this is available here: (<a
                        href="https://docs.mayan-edms.com/chapters/docker/building.html">https://docs.mayan-edms.com/chapters/docker/building.html</a>).
                    Be sure to use the CMU-313 repository on GitHub instead of the official repository on GitLab.</p>
                <p>Once you build a Docker image, you should run Mayan EDMS in a Docker container. You may first need to
                    set up containers for dependencies such as Postgresql and Redis. Refer to the <a
                        href="https://docs.mayan-edms.com/chapters/docker/install_simple.html">Docker installation
                        instructions</a>, but make sure to use the Mayan image that you just built instead of pulling it
                    from Docker Hub. We recommend <a
                        href="https://docs.mayan-edms.com/chapters/docker/docker_compose.html">using Docker compose</a>,
                    which automates some of these tasks using a handy compose file.</p>
                <p>If you ran Mayan EDMS successfully, you should be able to navigate to <code
                        class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://localhost</code> and see a web page with a
                    login screen. You may customize the port number that Mayan will be deployed to (default is <code
                        class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">80</code>).</p>
                <p><strong>Troubleshooting</strong>: If you have trouble building things locally, try pulling a
                    pre-built Docker image as shown in the <a
                        href="https://docs.mayan-edms.com/chapters/docker/install_simple.html">docs</a> or using the
                    upstream repository in order to precisely isolate the issue. If it takes you more than a few hours
                    to set all this up, STOP and ask for help on Slack.</p>
                <p>Once you have Mayan EDMS up and running locally, proceed to evaluate it using the Google Lighthouse
                    tool: <a
                        href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/">https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/</a>).
                    You can run Lighthouse as a stand alone application, or using the audit tab of google developer
                    tools. After you run Lighthouse, it will give you a score for various dimensions: Performance,
                    Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO.</p>
                <p>After looking over the metrics, pick one metric to improve. The Lighthouse reports will give you some
                    suggestions as to how to accomplish this. The only requirements are that your change should affect
                    the top level score, and that the change should involve a commit to the repo. HINT: Because of this,
                    you might want to avoid trying to change the performance score.</p>
                <p>First, open an issue in the <a href="https://github.com/CMU-313/Mayan-EDMS">parent repository</a> to
                    declare what aspect of Mayan you will be improving. You should look through existing issues, if any,
                    to avoid duplicates. In the issue description, mention the current lighthouse score you observed and
                    the warning that you are targeting. Tag the issue with one or more of the existing labels as
                    appropriate, add it to milestone “HW1”, and assign yourself.</p>
                <p>In your own fork of Mayan, create a feature branch, implement the change, test it out locally, and
                    commit your changes. Your commit message(s) must clearly describe what’s changing.</p>
                <p>Once you are satisfied, open a pull request in the parent repository. The PR should <a

                        the issue</a> that you previously opened (e.g. using the “resolve(s)” keyword), summarize the
                    changes, and describe how much the Lighthouse score improved by due to your change.</p>
                <p>After you have completed this task, we will ask you to reflect on the nature of metrics. To do this,
                    you will answer the following questions about metrics, specifically in the context of Mayan EDMS.
                    You should focus your answers for each of these questions on the one top level metric in Lighthouse
                    that you chose to improve.</p>

                        <p>What properties do we care about, and how do we measure them?</p>
                    <li>
                        <p>What is being measured? Does it (to what degree) capture the thing you care about? What are
                            its limitations?</p>
                    <li>
                        <p>How should this metric be incorporated into process? Check in gate? Once a month? Etc.</p>
                    <li>
                        <p>What are potentially negative side effects or incentives?</p>
