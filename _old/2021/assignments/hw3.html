                <p>In this homework, you will be eliciting requirements and documenting them for a <strong>graduate
                        school admission system</strong>. Your task is to elicit requirements for this new system and
                    document them. You will describe them using user stories and other descriptive text.</p>
                <p>Although you already started implementing a corresponding system in the last assignment, you did not
                    have an opportunity to gather requirements from real stakeholders. By doing so, you will see the
                    importance of engaging project stakeholders and specifying requirements in a document rather than
                    guessing requirements informally yourself. You may find that the requirements are substantially
                    different from the ones you would have come up with on your own.</p>
                <p>Learning Goals:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Elicit functional and quality requirements from stakeholders</p>
                    <li>
                        <p>Identify and describe the stakeholders and actors for a given system.</p>
                    <li>
                        <p>Synthesize requirements from various sources, including stakeholder interviews.</p>
                    <li>
                        <p>Create user stories documenting the functional requirements of the system.</p>
                    <li>
                        <p>Develop and apply appropriate metrics to specify and measure quality attributes.</p>
                </ul>

                <p>CMU has over 7,000 graduate students. The university uses a software system to manage the graduate
                    student admissions process, including collecting relevant information from applicants, accepting
                    recommendation letters from third-parties, showing this information to the admissions committee and
                    accepting ratings and commentary from the admissions committee to support decisions, and notifying
                    applicants of the decision. This system is old, clunky, and universally disliked.</p>
                <p>You and your team are developing a new system. Requirements for this new system remain a bit vague,
                    and in fact you hope to be able to use an initial prototype to help clarify those requirements with
                    stakeholders (in a future assignment!). In the meantime, your point of contact insists primarily
                    that the new system needs to be “less garbage” than the current system. When pressed for details,
                    she elaborates that faculty complain that the current system makes it too difficult to evaluate the
                    applicants; students (applicants) and their letter writers complain that the system is hard to use.
                    Everyone finds configuration and management difficult.</p>

                        </svg></a> Requirements Elicitation</h2>
                <p>Your team will seek information about requirements from public documents and observations of the
                    current and alternative systems, as well as from interviews with stakeholders.</p>
                <p>To better inform your questions, you might want to spend some time getting to understand the domain
                    (e.g., investigate existing systems and their documentation, including commercial competitors).</p>
                <p>You will do two types of interviews:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Practice interviews: Each team must do several practice interviews of a classmate who is a
                        member of another team. We pair up the teams for you below; negotiate amongst yourselves about
                        who on your team will serve as practice interviewees. Try to keep the practice interviewer
                        groups to 3 or fewer students total, to keep things tractable. Your group should conduct as many
                        practice interviews as necessary for your entire team to have participated in at least one.
                    <li>Each team member must participate in at least 2 interviews.
                </ul>
                <p>You will select stakeholders and contact them to schedule interviews yourself. We suggest you
                    schedule 15 to 30 minute interviews with each stakeholder and that you conduct interviews in person.
                    The potential stakeholders listed below have already agreed to serve as interviewees for a limited
                    number of interviews. Reach out to stakeholders early and negotiate a time for the interview. Notice
                    that these stakeholders have real, regular jobs and may need to squeeze interviews into a busy
                    schedule. Plan for most interviews during normal office hours. These stakeholders volunteer their
                    time for our class and may decline interviews if they get too many requests, requests on excessively
                    short notice, or requests that are not phrased in a polite and business-like manner. Please use this

                <p>Proceed as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Before the interviews, become familiar with the problem, for example through content analysis
                            of public information and other systems. Think about possible stakeholders, actors, quality
                            attributes, user stories, and assumptions for an actual implementation. Be deliberate about
                            who you want to interview. If you go into the interview unprepared, you are likely to miss
                            important questions.</p>
                    <li>
                        <p>Make appointments for the interviews, and plan them beforehand. You should use the interviews
                            to check your understanding of the problem and elicit additional requirements. Since some
                            people you are interviewing are usually not in the software field, you’ll have to work with
                            them to figure out what information is important to build the application.</p>
                    <li>
                        <p>Conduct the interviews. We suggest you conduct most interviews in groups, but you may further
                            divide roles as you prefer. Treat the interviewees and their time respectfully.</p>
                    <li>
                        <p>Take notes or if (and only if) the interviewee agrees, record the interview. Microphones in
                            most smartphones and laptops are good enough, but we suggest you test recording upfront. It
                            can be useful to partially transcribe an interview or at least its key points immediately
                            afterward, while the knowledge is fresh.</p>
                    <li>
                        <p>Revise your understanding of the problem, based on the interview.</p>
                    <li>
                        <p>Share your insights within your team and synthesize requirements, resolving potential
                            conflicts as far as possible. If there are conflicts you cannot resolve, make reasonable
                            assumptions and document how you would resolve them in practice.</p>
                    <li>
                        <p>Complete the requirements document, filling in the specific sections indicated both within
                            the template and below, in deliverables.</p>
                    <li>
                        <p>Reflect on your experience conducting the interview and the documents in a personal
                            statement.</p>

                        (75%)</strong></h3>
                <p>Each <em>team</em> should submit a single PDF of their completed requirements document to gradescope
                    <strong>by , October 26, 23:59pm.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Stakeholder and Actor Descriptions (Sections 1.3, 1.6, and 2.1, and Appendix A) - 15 points
                        (12.5%)</strong></p>
                <p>In the appendix, record which stakeholders you interviewed and their roles and which team members
                    participated in each interview.</p>
                <p>In the main requirements document, describe all relevant stakeholders, their interests, and their
                    importance to the system. Importance can be measured on any reasonable scale you define as long as
                    it is clear and a developer can read the document and understand which stakeholders are key.</p>
                <p>Describe the actors who will interact with the system as well as relevant factors about how they
                    relate to it. Good actor descriptions give enough information about the group/individual/system that
                    it is easy to identify their motivation in interacting with the system; their primary goals/needs in
                    doing so; how they typically interact with the system and their level of skill in doing so (when
                    referring to humans); and other system-relevant factors.</p>
                <p><strong>Functional requirements (user stories; Sections 2.2 and 2.3) - 40 points (33%)</strong></p>
                <p>Document the functional requirements in the form of <em>user stories</em>. Provide at least two user
                    stories per student in your group.</p>
                <p>For each user story, you should also include a discussion of two questions.</p>
                <p>1) How will you test this user story? If you cannot test your user story, it is overly vague. This is
                    also a signal that you don’t really understand it yet. For every user story you tackle, you should
                    be able to describe not only the user story, but how you will test it.</p>
                <p>2) When is this user story done? This is related, but a slightly different question. Many teams will
                    include a “definition of done” when developing user stories. This can help prevent misunderstandings
                    when it comes to who is responsible for work such as implementation and more.</p>
                <p>3) An estimate as to how long this user story will take to implement.</p>
                <p>Additionally, you will need to prioritize the requests you get from your stakeholders and decide
                    which of them you plan to support in your system (see also conflicts below). You should not write
                    user stories for everything your stakeholders mention; you should choose wisely according to a set
                    of features that is cohesive and represents a reasonable first iteration of a product.</p>
                <p><strong>Quality requirements (Section 3) 25 points (21%)</strong></p>
                <p>Define and order the <em>five</em> most important quality attributes within the context of the
                    system. A good description of quality attributes unambiguously defines what the requirements mean
                    within the context of the system; why each requirement deserves the given rank; how to measure each
                    requirement; and how those metrics should be interpreted. If two or more quality attributes are
                    equally important, it is acceptable to give them the same rank, but be sure to justify why they are
                    equally important.</p>
                <p><strong>Conflicts (Appendix B) 15 points (12.5%)</strong></p>
                <p>Briefly describe and discuss all conflicts you identify during elicitation. For conflicts that you
                    could resolve, describe how you resolved them. For conflicts that you could not resolve within this
                    assignment, briefly outline how you would resolve them if you were doing this for a real customer
                    (e.g., be concrete of whom you might ask which question and how answers would inform your decision).
                </p>
                <p><strong>Quality Assurance (Appendix C), 25 points (21 %)</strong></p>
                <p>In class, we discussed the INVEST method for quality assurance of user stories. For N user stories,
                    where N is the number of people in your team, explicitly argue why the user stories do follow the
                    INVEST criteria. If you have to make tradeoffs in one dimensions because of another dimension, you
                    should argue that tradeoff explicitly.</p>

                <p>In a reflection document of two pages or less (soft limit) describe what insights (if any) you gained
                    from going through the requirements process, including conducting interviews and synthesizing and
                    documenting requirements. The reflection can include both positive and negative aspects and can set
                    them in context with experience outside of class, if applicable. Use specific examples from your

                    <li>
                        <p>How do the current system requirements compare to the (implicit) requirements used to create
                            the feature your team developed in Homework 2? What would you do different for Homework 2
                            with that information?</p>
                    <li>
                        <p>How do current systems requirements fit with the decision to build on the Mayan EDMS
                            platform? Are there any requirements that are less feasible given that you are building on
                            the Mayan platform?</p>

                <p>Schedule your interviews as soon as possible. Please contact your TA if you have any issues. You will
                    need to be respectful of the fact that the stakeholders are real people with their own schedules and
                    responsibilities; if you wait too long, you may not be able to complete your interviews.</p>

                <p>You will be graded as a team, with an individual component. This homework is worth 160 points, as
                    divided above. We provide additional detail on what constitutes full-credit solutions in the
                    narrative above; a summary is below.</p>
                <p>For the group component, we expect all below-listed information to be appropriately organized in a
                    document that follows the template we provide. Additionally:</p>
                <p>To receive full credit on the interviews and stakeholders and actor descriptions, we expect, based on
                    your interviews:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>A concise indication of whom you interviewed and their role in the system. For practice
                            interviews, list who was interviewed (and who participated in each) and indicate the role
                            the interviewee pretended to play.</p>
                    <li>
                        <p>A complete and well-described set of relevant system stakeholders, including their roles,
                            interests, and importance in the system.</p>
                    <li>
                        <p>A complete and well-described set of actors, including their role in and, mode of interaction
                            with the system, and other system-relevant features.</p>
                </ul>
                <p>To receive full credit on the functional requirements, we expect:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>At least 2<em>n</em> user stories (for a team with <em>n</em> members) that describe
                            important system functionality at an adequate level of detail and quality.</p>
                    <li>
                        <p>For each user story, in addition to the “as a _____…” we expect the following additional
                            info:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>

                                <p>How long you estimate it will take to implement this user story (with a brief
                                    justification for the estimate)</p>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
                <p>To receive full credit on the quality attributes, we expect:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The identification and description of at least five (5) quality attributes, including a ranking
                        of their importance and a coherent justification of that ranking.
                </ul>
                <p>To receive full credit on the conflicting requirements, we expect:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>A description of all conflicts you identify during elicitation.</p>
                    <li>
                        <p>For conflicts that you can resolve, describe how you resolved them. For conflicts that you
                            cannot resolve within this assignment, briefly outline how you could resolve them if you
                            were doing this for a real customer</p>
                </ul>
                <p>To receive full credit on the quality assurance discussion, we expect:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>an explicit discussion of why N of your stories follow the INVEST principles, with tradeoffs
                        justified.
                </ul>
                <p>To receive full credit on the individual reflection, we expect:</p>

                            interview, and synthesis and expression process.</p>
                    <li>
                        <p>An analysis beyond mere descriptions and superficial statements, including supporting
                            evidence for claims, that reflects on the causes of identified issues or your own
                            experience.</p>
