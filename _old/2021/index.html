                <p>Successful software projects require more than just technical expertise. Figuring out what the client
                    wants, collaborating in a team, managing complexity, mitigating risks, staying on time and budget,
                    and determining under various constraints when a product is good enough to be shipped are at least
                    equally important topics that often have a significant human component. 17-313 explores these issues
                    broadly covering the fundamentals of modern software engineering.</p>
                <p>Assuming reasonably solid programming skills (including unit testing and code-level design), we will
                    explore the following topics:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Process consideration for software development</strong> (How do avoid problems early?
                            When and how much to design? When and how much to test? When and how to involve the
                            customers? Agile methods…)</p>
                    <li><strong>Requirements elicitation, documentation, and evaluation</strong> (How to figure out what
                        the customer really wants? Who else has an interest? How can we measure success objectively? How
                        can we reliably document expectations? …)
                    <li><strong>Design for quality attributes</strong> (How can we design a system to be able to scale
                        to millions of users? How can we design security into a system? …)
                    <li><strong>Strategies for quality assurance,</strong> including measurement, inspection, and static
                        and dynamic analysis(What quality assurance strategy is best for a given system? What can we
                        automate and when should we keep humans in the loop? How much testing and what kind of testing
                        should we do? What qualities are important to assure beyond functional correctness? Can we
                        evaluate usability, scalability, reliability, performance? How can we statically guarantee the
                        absence of certain security issues? …)
                    <li><strong>Empirical methods in software engineering</strong> (How can we measure quality
                        attributes such as performance, security, and reliability? How can we measure how users interact
                        with the system? How can we know whether the difference matters? …)
                    <li><strong>Time and team management</strong> (How to estimate the duration and costs of a project?
                        How to monitor progress and risks to recognize issues early? How to coordinate developers in a
                        team? How to form and develop teams? How to select and motivate team members? How to deal with
                        team dynamics such as social loafing? …)
                    <li><strong>Economics of software development</strong> (business models, outsourcing, open source,
                        …)
                </ul>
                <p>This course has a strong technical focus, and includes assignments with and without programming.
                    Assignments also include written components. Students will get experience with team management and
                    modern software-engineering tools. The course puts students on a fast track toward project
                    management positions.</p>
                <p>Assignments (mostly done in groups) include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An introduction assignment where individual students will learn to engage with an existing code
                        base.
                    <li>A requirements assignment in which each team will interview stakeholders to elicit and document
                        requirements for a software system.
                    <li>An architecture assignment in which teams will train and deploy an ML model using microservices.
                    <li>A project in which each team contributes to an open source project of their choice. This
                        involves identifying an issue in the existing project, understanding the development process of
                        that project and how to contribute, and actually making a contribution such as fixing a bug or
                        adding a feature. Extra credit will be awarded if the contribution is merged into the project.
