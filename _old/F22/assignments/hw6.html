                <p>In this assignment, your high-level goal is to produce and submit a non-trivial modification or
                    extension to an open-source project in a way that maximizes the chances that the project maintainers
                    accept it.</p>
                <p>If you demonstrate to us that your change has been accepted and integrated into the project’s code
                    base, you will get <strong>20 bonus points</strong>. Your team will select an open source project,
                    select a change to implement, actually contribute to the project, and present your insights to the
                    class. You will individually reflect on your teamwork and open source experience.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>The open source project you pick should be <em>active, with multiple contributors.</em> Generally you
                    want to pick projects that are <strong>quick at reviewing &amp; accepting PRs from external
                        contributors</strong> for a better chance of getting your bonus. Previous students have lamented
                    choosing dead or maintenance projects without sufficient community support. Do not make this
                    mistake.</p>

                <p><em>For the rest of this assignment, we will refer to bug fixes and feature extensions as tasks.</em>
                    You are free to chose the task, as long as they:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>are taken from a bug report or feature request in a public database or message board. <strong>Do
                            not invent a task. Address a documented project need.</strong>
                    <li>make changes to the project’s source code. <strong>Pure documentation or design tasks are not
                            appropriate</strong>
                    <li>benefit from teamwork and are appropriate for your team size (i.e., do not select one small
                        independent task per team member). You may choose one large task or several smaller, related
                        tasks. The tasks should be scoped such that each team member spends <strong>one week of
                            development effort</strong>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Communicate with the project owners the task you are trying to do so that they would be more
                        likely to accept your request in the future.</strong> If you have questions on these criteria,
                    contact the course staff.</p>

                <p>Once you have selected a project and task(s), break them down into subtasks, consider their priority
                    and assign them to each team member. Identify a set of tasks as your core goal for this project, and
                    another set of tasks as stretch goals.</p>
                <p>You are expected to achieve your core goal for this project, and stretch goals as much as possible.
                    We will work with you to adjust your goals during the check-in to ensure that they are appropriate
                    your team size and timeframe.</p>
                <p>As per previous homeworks, plan before you start coding. You should identify risks and requirements,
                    and develop a collaboration plan and schedule.</p>

                <p>You should perform adequate quality assurance activities when writing code.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Take further steps to understand the project’s code.</strong><br /> You might find it
                            useful to engage in intra-team discussions using static or dynamic diagrams. You might also
                            find it useful to elicit feedback on your ideas by communicating with members of the
                            open-source community.</p>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Submit your changes to the project</strong><br /> Create any necessary documentation
                            to enable acceptance of your code. Common contribution mechanisms include pull requests,
                            emails to a project lead, or discussion board posts. You may also need to update the bug
                            database. The project owners will review and evaluate your pull request, and you might need
                            more work to get it approved.<br /> <strong>You are required to submit your work to the
                                open-source project</strong></p>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>BONUS: Get your changes accepted</strong><br /> You will get a bonus <strong>20 (6%)
                                bonus points</strong> upon acceptance. If your code is accepted after the homework
                            deadline but before the final exam, inform the course staff.</p>

                <p>The recitation after thanksigiving will be dedicated to an <strong>in-person</strong> group
                    presentation about your project and task selection.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Presentations are <strong>6 minutes, with 3 minutes feedback and Q&amp;A</strong>.
                    <li>The order of presentations will be randomly determined.
                    <li>Participation from all team members during the presentation is <strong>required</strong>.
                    <li>For full credit, you would have to be on time for the presentation session (within 5 minutes of
                        recitation start time). If you are unable to attend in-person, you have to send a slack message
                        to your TA with justifications <strong>24 hours before the start of your recitation</strong>
                        else you will receive <strong>no credit</strong> for this part of the assignment. You will then
                        present by recording your segment of the presentation, which your teammate will play during the
                        presentation.

                        task chosen was reasonable</strong></p>
                <p>Your <strong>6-minute</strong> check-in presentation should include (the recommended slides amount is

                        selected, summarizing the relevant characteristics you considered when making your selection.
                        Beyond whatever additional information you collect in your research, include at least a name, a
                        website link, and a brief description of the project (what it does, who uses it, etc).
                    <li><strong>Successful build</strong> (~1 slide) <br /> Evidence that you can build and run the
                        software (e.g., a screenshot or text output from a successful build, a screenshot of the running
                        program). Getting an open-source project to build/run can be a huge effort, and we want to
                        mitigate this risk.

                            <li>A brief textual description of your proposed change(s). In addition to your core
                                task(s), you may choose to include a stretch task, depending on how difficult the
                                changes end up being, you may not need to implement it. Note that if your actual changes
                                deviate from the plan, we expect a short explanation with the final submission.
                            <li>A justification why the task(s) benefit(s) from teamwork and are appropriate for your
                                team size.
                        </ul>
                    <li><strong>Task link(s)</strong> (~ 1 slide) <br /> Evidence that the task(s) is/are requested by
                        the community (links suffices).
                    <li><strong>Subtasks &amp; assignments</strong> (~ 1 slide)<br /> A table to summarize for each
                        subtask<ul>
                            <li>description of each subtask

                    recommended slides amount is in parenthesis):</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>High-level project overview</strong> (~1 slide)<ul>
                            <li>Describe the project in terms of its high-level goals and the context in which it
                                operates. This may include a brief history and the business context. E.g. it may be
                                interesting to note that a project was spawned from a closed-source operation, or that
                                it competes primarily with a closed-source counterpart.
                        </ul>
                    <li><strong>Brief description of the task you performed</strong> (~2 slides)<ul>
                            <li><strong>Brief</strong> description of the task(s) you performed, such that the audience
                                has sufficient context to understand your explanation of your experiences.
                            <li>We <strong>do not expect you to include, for example, any code or diagrams from your
                                    report</strong>, unless they’re helpful for supporting a point about your
                                interactions with the project.
                            <li>A demo is appreciated, but please do a screen recording instead of a live demo.
                        </ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Project processes and communication</strong> (~2 slides)<br /> Describe the processes
                            and tools the project uses to coordinate among contributors. For example: Are these
                            processes formal or informal? Provide an explicit description (possibly with a diagram) of
                            the acceptance process used for efforts like the task you completed. If applicable, include
                            standards or expectations regarding software engineering activities including requirements,
                            architecture, and quality assurance; alternatively mention that no such standards exist.</p>
                    <li><strong>Your experiences</strong> (~2 slides)<br /> Summarize your experiences (and what you
                        learned!) interacting with this community of open source developers, focusing on any surprising
                        or unusual aspects of the process or interaction. For example:<ul>
                            <li>Did you run into any trouble understanding, changing, or contributing to a large,
                                pre-existing project?
                            <li>Were there unanticipated challenges in either implementing your change, or in getting
                                the change submitted to and accepted by the project maintainers?
                            <li>Did the project collaboration process or culture help or hinder your effort in any way?
                                Characterize any interaction you had with the team leadership and community,
                                highlighting especially any useful/useless input you received. You may (but are not
                                required to) also relate the experience from this homework assignment with relevant
                                experience from internships or other projects.
                        </ul>
                </ol>
                <p>Your summary of your experiences can be at whatever level of detail you think is interesting or
                    informative. Given the time limit, selecting and highlighting the two or three most important or
                    interesting observations is likely more useful than trying to be complete.</p>
                <p>You must upload your slides as <strong>a single PDF document</strong> to Gradescope.</p>

                <p><strong>Points</strong>: 120<br /> <strong>Due Date</strong>: 15 December 2022, 2359</p>
                <p>After completing and submitting the modification, write a report about the tasks you have performed.
                </p>
                <p>Your report should include:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Selected project</strong> (1 paragraph)<br /> A brief description of the open source
                        system to which you contributed. You may reuse text from Part A.
                    <li><strong>Project context and business model</strong> (&lt;0.5 page) <br /> An analysis of the
                        open-source project’s context and business model. This may include a short history of the
                        project, competing open- and closed-source projects, or a discussion of the developers’
                        motivations to build this system. Essentially, we want to know why this project exists and why
                        it is important.
                    <li><strong>Task description (per task)</strong> (&lt;0.5 page) <br /> A description of the tasks
                        you have implemented and a high-level description of how you implemented them.
                    <li><strong>Submitted artifacts (per task)</strong><br /> Evidence of the code, documentation, or
                        other artifacts you produced for the task, and evidence that you submitted them to the project.
                        This would likely be links to publicly available resources (repository, email, pull request,
                        etc).
                    <li><strong>QA strategy</strong> (&lt;1 page)<br /> Describe which QA activities you performed and
                        justify why you selected these QA activities over others. Describe metrics if appropriate. The
                        justification will likely refer to relevant requirements as well as to the project’s practices.
                    <li><strong>QA evidence</strong><br /> Evidence of your quality assurance activities described
                        above. For example, provide source code or links to source code of tests, provide test
                        protocols, comments or protocols from code reviews, reports from static analysis tools, links to
                        or screenshots from a continuous integration platform, and so forth.
                    <li><strong>Plan updates</strong> (&lt;1 page)<br /> A description and justification of deviations
                        between your initial plans and your performed activities (as in Homework 2). Changes are
                        expected, but they should be tracked and explained. Describe changes in scope (e.g., fewer
                        tasks) and in the schedule and work allocation. Provide an updated schedule and note
                        differences. Explain the causes of the changes, such as unanticipated risks.
                    <li><strong>BONUS</strong><br /> Evidence that your changes have been accepted into the code base of
                        the open source project in forms of links or screenshots. <strong>Note: You can also send the
                            merged PR link via Slack to Michael Hilton by 19th December 1pm to claim this bonus as
                            well</strong>

                <p><strong>Points</strong>: 20<br /> <strong>Due Date</strong>: 15 December 2022, 2359</p>
                <p>Your indiviudal reflection should include:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Self Evaluation</strong> <br /> Describe the work you have done in this project (e.g.
                        code artifacts, documentation) as well as efforts towards helping your team towards completing
                        this project (e.g. research, organizing meetings, running meetings).
                    <li><strong>Peer Evaluations</strong><br /> Describe the specific work <strong>each of your team
                            members</strong> have contributed towards this project. Describe both tangible (e.g. code
                        artifacts, report &amp; slides making, documentation) and intangible (e.g. organizing &amp;
                        running meetings, communicating expectations) contributions. Do point out teammates that you
                        think are exceptional to work with in this project as well.
                    <li><strong>Teamwork</strong><br /> You have been in the same team over the course of this semester
                        (HW 2-6). Look back on the entire semester and reflect on your team experiences. The following
                        questions may guide you:<ul>
                            <li>What has worked, what hasn’t?
                            <li>If you could start 313 or another course over with the same team, what would you change?
                            <li>What have you learned about teamwork and your role in teamwork?
                            <li>(Optional) Do you have any feedback on what we can do next year to help students work
                                more effectively in teams? Bear in mind that the instructor-assigned heterogeneous teams
                                of 3-5 students is non-negotiable. We anticipate problems as part of the learning
                                experience, but would like to avoid unduly frustrating situations.
                        </ul>
                </ol>
                <p>A good reflection document will include concrete statements about lessons learned, with clear
                    supporting evidence, such as examples, to support them. Submit your reflection on
                    <strong>Gradescope</strong>.</p>
