                <p>In HW2, you familiarized yourself with Teedy; You set up your development environment and workflow,
                    and explored the full layers of Teedy by implementing a small feature change or addition. Now, we
                    want to take a more <strong>serious</strong> step to build the graduate student admission management
                    system.</p>
                <p>You and your team are beginning to sketch out and implement a replacement admissions system. You
                    start with a simplified workflow that you hope to build from later: assume a single academic
                    program, and that applicants upload single resumes to apply. Resumes are assessed by 3--4 reviewers
                    along several dimensions (like “skills”, “experience”, “GPA”, etc), along with additional
                    notes/commentary. This information is used to inform admissions committee discussions and decisions.
                </p>
                <p>Your first goal is to decide which feature you should/will implement to improve the system. Have an
                    initial brainstorming meeting, and come up with a feature that touches all three layers (Java
                    Backend, REST middleware, and Angular.js frontend). Here are some of the features that teams
                    implemented in the past:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>A dashboard or pane for reviewer assignment and management.</p>
                    <li>
                        <p>A form for reviewers to enter and score candidates along various (custom/admissions-specific)
                            directions, to be saved and possibly aggregated across multiple reviewers.</p>
                    <li>
                        <p>A dashboard or pane for aggregating and displaying statistics, like average review score per
                            candidate; average review score per reviewer; or other aggregate statistics for the
                            applicant pool.</p>
                </ol>
                <p>Then, you will do so, over the course of a 2-week sprint, while establishing and following a good
                    software engineering process, including appropriate git flow and testing of the eventual feature.
                    Specifically, this entails:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>Do an initial sprint planning meeting. Assess your feature options and choose which one you
                            will implement first, for this assignment. Construct your <em>backlog</em> (decompose the
                            task, roughly estimate the time required for the sub-tasks, identify dependencies, and plan
                            the implementation accordingly). The selected feature should (1) be able to be divided into
                            at least N (the number of team members in your team) sub-features, and (2) require you to
                            make changes in each of the three layers of Teedy’s stack.</p>
                    <li>
                        <p>Perform a 2-week sprint to implement and user test the feature in question. You will likely
                            not have time to produce a perfect feature, but you should be able to produce a reasonable
                            prototype.</p>
                    <li>
                        <p>Throughout the project, track your time investment, synchronize tasks with your team, and
                            regularly update the plan. Take meeting minutes and track how you divide up the work.</p>
                    <li>
                        <p>Document your code/feature, user testing approach, and process and decision-making. It should
                            be easy for the TA to run and test your feature within Teedy.</p>
                </ol>
                <p>We encourage you to read and follow the <a href="../assets/pdfs/team_policy.pdf">Team Policy</a>,
                    which has suggestions for effective group work in a course setting (you may have to adapt some of
                    these suggestions for collaborating on a software project, but you may still find the structure
                    helpful).</p>
                <p>Plan carefully to decide which features to develop, and in what order, and then start writing code
                    effectively as a team.</p>

                <p>You can still import the changes you have made for HW2 into your new repository. Be sure to use good
                    development practices. We will be grading you on how well you follow the process we covered in the
                    lectures and recitations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>use a kanban board to manage the workflow,
                    <li>create issues for feature improvements or bug-fixes,
                    <li>when creating issues, assign team members and tag them with appropriate labels,
                    <li>create a pull request and reference the issue to merge the changes,
                    <li>provide feedback to pull requests,
                    <li>document design decisions and implemented functionalities,
                    <li>write automated tests for the features you implement,
                    <li>and use GitHub Actions for continuous integration (CI).
                </ul>
                <p>Like in HW2, you will not create an issue or a pull request in the parent repository, but in your
                    team repository. It is not acceptable for one person to commit all work after synchronizing through
                    other means. This will factor into your grade.</p>
                <p>The <em>code, testing, and documentation deliverables</em> below will be taken by snapshotting your
                    repository at the deadline.</p>

                <p>This homework has three (3) deadlines and four (4) deliverables. The first deadline (Thursday,
                    September 29, 23:59) is for an <strong>initial</strong> <strong>planning document and
                        backlog</strong>. The second deadline (Thursday, October 6, 23:59) is for the <strong>technical
                        artifacts</strong>. The third deadline (Thursday, October 13, 23:59) is for <strong>two (2)
                        reflection tasks</strong>. We intentionally separated these deadlines to ensure upfront
                    documentation of the planning process and to give you time to reflect. Of course, you are still
                    encouraged to start developing before the second deadline and reflecting before the third.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>An initial technical/sprint plan and backlog, with justification.</strong> First,
                            indicate which feature you chose to implement first, and why. Then, present your initial
                            backlog for the sprint (from before you started implementing; you will discuss
                            changes/replanning that happened in a later deliverable). You are encouraged to include
                            supporting evidence for all of your decisions and estimates (i.e., an explanation for how
                            you arrived at that decision/value). To grade your team, we will be looking for the
                            following information to be documented in your team’s <strong>GitHub Projects
                                board</strong>:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>a set of overall tasks necessary to implement the feature (these tasks together
                                    should result in a feature, but each task is a small step along the way to the
                                    feature),</p>
                            <li>
                                <p>estimated effort for each task,</p>
                            <li>
                                <p>dependencies among tasks,</p>
                            <li>
                                <p>which you plan to tackle for the first sprint to build the core functionality,</p>
                            <li>
                                <p>task assignments for team members for the initial sprint planning,</p>
                            <li>
                                <p>acceptance criteria (how do you tell when this task is done - you can think about how
                                    you will test this feature).</p>
                        </ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>An initial process plan.</strong> On Gradescope, you will describe the
                            <em>process</em> you are planning to follow. By process, we mean <em>how</em> you are going
                            to develop the system and which steps you are going to follow, rather than a technical
                            design model of the software. Specifically, we are interested in how you are planning to
                            collaborate (e.g., communication channels, meetings and their frequency, pull requests or
                            dropbox) and in what overall development activities you plan (e.g., how much design, which
                            quality assurance steps, how shall parts be integrated).</p>
                </ul>
                <p>We will not grade the accuracy of your prediction or how well you stuck with your initial plan;
                    instead, we will focus on how well you decomposed the problem and justified your original plan, how
                    you responded to changes in the replanning, and how well you analyze and reflect on your experience
                    (see below).</p>

                        </svg></a> 2) Code artifacts (due Thursday, October 6, 23:59) – 60 points</h3>
                <p>We will take a snapshot of the implementation from your team’s GitHub repository at the deadline.</p>
                <p>Your repository should include the implementation of the system, automated tests for the new feature,
                    and a documentation of how to use and user test your new feature (indicate where this documentation
                    is found from the top-level README.md file).</p>
                <p>You should follow best practices for collaborative development such as using feature branches, pull
                    requests, and code review (e.g., tackling each layer of the stack in a separate PR). Specifically
                    your team should collaborate on this feature by committing changes to a branch named for the feature
                    you are implementing.</p>
                <p>GitHub Actions should be enabled. It is reasonable to have failures in feature branches, but you
                    should do your best to make your main branch build consistently pass.</p>
                <p><img src="../assets/images/build_pass.png" alt="Build Pass" /></p>
                <p>Adhere to good coding practices. For example, your code should have a clear structure, be reasonably
                    modularized, use appropriate variable names, and be documented.</p>
                <p><strong>We expect you to write a set of <em>automated</em> tests that demonstrates the
                        functionalities you implemented (according to your acceptance criteria from the initial
                        planning).</strong></p>
                <p>We will look at the commit, issue, and pull request history.</p>
                <p>Every member of your team must contribute to the implementation: each team member must have at least
                    one commit as a part of the solution. Failure to do so will result in a significant penalty to your
                    grade.</p>
                <p>You must commit all of your changes to the main branch of your repository before the homework
                    deadline. Unlike HW01, you should not submit your changes to the parent Teedy repository.</p>

                <p>After coding is complete, reflect on your experience as a team. Again, we look for honest reflection,
                    which will likely include reflection on failures. We will not grade whether you predicted the effort
                    correctly, but rather what you learned from the process. There will be 5 reflection questions on
                    Gradescope:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Actual Schedule:</strong> Document the <em>actual</em> schedule, including the tasks
                            you <em>actually</em> performed and the <em>actual</em> amount of time each took. Ideally,
                            you will have kept your schedule up-to-date throughout the project, simplifying this task.
                        </p>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Schedule Deviations:</strong> Reflect on the differences between the initial and the
                            final schedule. Which milestones were predicted correctly? What was re-planned? Were there
                            any activities you didn’t plan for initially or that you had to drop in the end? What were
                            the reasons for the changes? Could they have been foreseen with better planning?</p>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Process:</strong> Reflect on the <em>process</em> you initially planned to follow,
                            and the process you actually followed. Was the process adequate? Did you skip steps or adopt
                            additional techniques during the project? What challenges did you face? How could the
                            process be improved if you had to do another, similar project? How might you have to change
                            the process to adapt to a different type of project?</p>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Team Experience:</strong> Reflect on your experience working as a team. What worked
                            well? Were team meetings efficient? How well, and through which processes, did you
                            communicate? What needs improvement? Were there any teamwork challenges you resolved as the
                            project progressed?</p>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Meeting Minutes:</strong> Attach all meeting minutes kept throughout the project,
                            which should include information about the agenda/topics discussed, decisions made, and work
                            assignments. Recording results of meetings can be onerous; you must explicitly rotate this
                            responsibility among the members of your team (and indicate who took which minutes).</p>
                </ul>
                <p>One of the main purposes of this homework is to encourage <em>in-depth analysis</em> of the reasons
                    for good or bad time estimation, scheduling, and teamwork coordination. Doing poorly in these is not
                    unusual (as numerous reports from real-life projects show). Therefore, we will not evaluate how well
                    (or badly) the project went, but instead <em>how well you understood the reasons
                        [why]{.underline}</em> the project went as it did, and what lessons you drew from your
                    experience to inform your future work. A good reflection document will include concrete statements
                    about lessons learned, with clear supporting evidence, such as examples, to support the claims. It
                    is a good idea to <em>reference your meeting protocols</em> to support your claims and provide
                    examples. For example, “We could have communicated better.” is weakly supported. One could
                    strengthen it with examples from the development experience as follows: “One source of
                    [defects/development slowdown/quality problems] was the integration of components A and B, because
                    the API for A was not well-understood by the developer of B…In the future, we might try to use
                    [such-and-such a process] for clearly documenting and communicating such design decisions, rather
                    than [the process we did follow/failed to follow].”</p>
                <p>Being able to communicate effectively is an important software engineering skill. As such, your
                    reflection should be well-written and easy to read. Be sure to leave time after writing for revision
                    and proofreading. There are many convenient tools for collaborative text editing; the course staff
                    used Google Docs for this homework document.</p>

                <p>You will answer individual reflection questions on Gradescope (HW3 Individual Reflection). We will
                    ask you to reflect on the process, scheduling, and teamwork.</p>
                <p>(Note that this is due at the same time as the team reflection.)</p>
                <p>Separate from the reflection done as a group, each team member should individually reflect on (1) the
                    process, (2) the scheduling, and (3) the teamwork, and <em>connect this project experience with
                        their previous experience</em> (preferably experience from a non-academic setting, but
                    experience from class projects is also fine). You do not need to answer any specific questions, but
                    the following questions may guide possible content for the reflection: How does this project
                    experience align with your previous experiences? What was similar? What was different? What did you
                    personally learn from this project’s development process? Is there something you are planning to do
                    differently in your future projects? Similar to the team reflection task, we will grade the
                    <em>quality</em> and <em>depth</em> of your reflection.</p>

                <p>You will be graded as a team, with an individual component. This homework is worth 240 points. We
                    will grade you based on the learning goals listed above.</p>
                <p>The initial planning constitutes 60 points (25%), the technical artifacts and adherence to the
                    process constitute 60 points (25%), the team reflection constitutes 60 points (25%), and the
                    individual reflection constitutes 60 points (25%).</p>
                <p>To receive full credit for the planning, we expect:</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>An analysis beyond mere descriptions and superficial statements, including supporting
                            evidence for claims, that reflects on the causes of deviations, conflicts, and so forth, or

                <p>This homework (except for the individual reflection) is to be done in your assigned teams. You are
                    highly encouraged to openly discuss all team issues that may arise in the process of working within
                    the teams. After this homework, we will perform a peer-feedback survey to identify any common issues
                    that we will then address in class. If severe issues occur reach out earlier to the course staff.
