                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Design, implement, and test a microservice.</p>
                    <li>

                        </svg></a> Project context</h2>
                <p>You and your team are hard at work on the new graduate admissions system for CMU. During your most
                    recent sprint planning meeting, your CMU technical contact bursts into the room, shouting, “Machine
                    learning! Microservices!” When pressed, your newly buzzword-enamored boss explains: the population
                    of applicants is too large, and increasing annually. Admissions is taking too much time and effort.
                    Fortunately, CMU has been collecting student performance data. They continue: “Can’t your team make
                    use of all that fancy new machine learning to help predict which applicants are more likely to
                    succeed, helping the admissions process along? And since we’re checking off buzzwords, can’t you
                    implement it as a microservice?”</p>
                <p>You are correctly skeptical about the effort required to pivot the product in this new direction, but
                    fortunately the somewhat disconnected microservice demand gives you a way to explore the idea
                    without requiring a major up front change in the existing codebase. Instead, you’ll (1) develop this
                    potential feature in isolation by training a machine learning model that predicts potential
                    applicant success and deploying it as a microservice, and then (2) reason about, document, and
                    choose between alternative designs that would allow you to integrate it into the existing codebase.
                    Finally, you will (3) individually consider the ethical implications of the feature, and what
                    questions you truly need to ask in QA to satisfy possible ethical concerns.</p>

                <p>Create a new team repository using this <a
                        href="https://classroom.github.com/a/dlSY38y3">repository</a> as a template.</p>
                <p>The starter code includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>an example Flask-based app in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">app/</code>
                        directory. Use this as a template to build and deploy the microservice. You may wish to use <a
                            href="https://towardsdatascience.com/a-flask-api-for-serving-scikit-learn-models-c8bcdaa41daa">this
                            article</a> and <a href="https://github.com/amirziai/sklearnflask/">this repository</a> as
                        resources on building and saving a scikit-learn model, and then deploying it using Flask.
                        <strong>MAKE SURE</strong> to read the <code
                            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README.MD</code> of the repository to learn
                        about and use Pipenv, as it will allow for hassle-free collaboration.
                    <li>a default model under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">app/</code>, which can
                        be explored with the Jupyter notebook (<code
                            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">model_build.ipnyb</code>). You will need to
                        create a better-performing model as a part of this homework.
                </ul>
                <p>We provide you with a (synthetic) historical dataset (as a CSV file) of student performance (this is
                    an augmented version of the dataset found <a
                        href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance">here</a>), and a (bad) model
                    trained over it. Start by exploring the data, to understand what information is available. Student
                    performance is described by their grades (G1, G2, and G3), where G3 is the final year grade, the
                    target performance metric. Grades are on a scale of 0-20; 20 is the best. CMU considers a
                    high-quality student one with a G3 grade of 15 or higher.</p>
                <p>The existing model in the repository is very simple. Once you have familiarized yourself with the
                    dataset, explore this model using whatever means you think are appropriate and determine in which
                    ways you don’t believe it to be suitable. Based on what you learn in this exploratory step, you
                    should train a new model and build a deployable microservice.</p>
                <p>You should evaluate your new model, and should explain how this model (overall) performs better than
                    the baseline model, and any ways in which your model performs worse than the baseline model.</p>
                <p>Plan some testing, perform that testing on your microservice endpoints, and document it. You should
                    create a test suite using, for example, <a
                        href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/testing">pytest</a>, and update your GitHub
                    Actions workflow to run the test suite.</p>
                <p>This starter code uses arguments from the query string (specifically age, health, and absences) to
                    query the model. This can/should be expanded or replaced as a part of your implementation (note that
                    the API also accepts JSON requests).</p>
                <p>Note that the default Flask service in the starter code should be run, and is accessible, on port 80.

                <p>This homework has three (3) deadlines and four (4) deliverables. The first deadline (Tuesday,
                    November 1st) is a checkpoint to make sure you and your team are succeeding at building your
                    microservice-based ML model. The second deadline (Tuesday, Nov 8th) is for the complete trained
                    model deployable as a microservice, and a design document explaining how you would integrate the new
                    feature into your existing codebase. The third deadline (Thursday, Nov 10th) is for one (1)
                    individual document making an ethical argument about the feature.</p>

                    points</h3>
                <p>For this checkpoint, you and your team should make sure that all of you are working on the same
                    versions of Python and Python packages. You should use <a href="https://swagger.io/docs">Swagger</a>
                    to define and document the REST API for your microservice, and write a set of API tests that encode
                    the expected functionality of your API (via <a
                        href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/testing">pytest</a>). Note that, for this
                    deadline, the API does not need to be functional; it is only required that you create placeholder
                    REST API endpoints that you can use to write your tests. <strong>NOTE: We expect your tests to be
                        failing at this point. The implementation that allows the tests to pass will be written
                        later.</strong></p>
                <p>The deliverable for this checkpoints are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>a PDF and YAML version of your Swagger documentation. Note that you can create a PDF of your
                        Swagger documentation via the Print Preview function of your browser.
                    <li>a set of API tests within your GitHub repository. Consider both expected behavior and edge
                        cases.

                <p>The deliverable for this task is a documented technical artifact; submit a link of your GitHub
                    repository to the Gradescope assignment. This should include:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>a complete implementation that includes the API endpoints that you previously defined, and
                            returns a prediction using your trained model.</p>
                    <li>
                        <p>an updated README that clearly and concisely describes features used to training your model,
                            and how your retrained the model performs better than the baseline model.</p>
                </ol>

                <p>Once you have demoed this feature, and shown that it can provide value, you are now faced with a
                    decision about how to implement a long term solution here. You have at least several options
                    including but not limited to:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>Rewrite the feature in Java and incorporate it into the monolith</p>
                    <li>Keep python demo microservice implementation, and deploy as a seperate service, integrating with
                        your existing monolith via REST API
                    <li>Refactor part or all of the existing monolith into a microservices based architecture
                </ol>
                <p>Your deliverable for this part is a design document describing the feature and how it should be
                    integrated into the system as a microservice. Submit this to the assignment on Gradescope. (NOTE:
                    you will not have to actually implement this decision, for this or any subsequent homework in this
                    class. You might consider implementation effort as part of your tradeoff analysis, but you should
                    not let speculation about your workload in this class influence your decision.)</p>
                <p>The design document must (1) concisely describe the feature, (2) make and justify a decision on how
                    the implementation should be done, including considered alternatives and tradeoffs, and
                    using/referencing suitable diagrams where relevant to support your argument:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>Feature description. This should be concise (&lt; 0.5 pages).</p>
                    <li>
                        <p>Decision and architectural justification for how to integrate the feature into the system.
                            This must include at least:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>A concise, prioritized list of the overall quality requirements you considered in
                                    arguing for the integration of the feature into the system (&lt;0.5 pages, soft
                                    limit). You may consider and reference the requirements you elicited during HW3 as
                                    appropriate. Rank them in decreasing order of importance. This allows readers to
                                    quickly understand what requirements you were designing for.</p>
                            <li>
                                <p>A design decision with a textual justification of your design. (~2 pages, soft limit,
                                    including alternatives and tradeoffs, below) Outline and argue for a particular
                                    implementation choice as to how the feature should be integrated into the overall
                                    system architecturally. Justify your design decisions, including why your design is
                                    adequate for the quality attributes important to this system, and what assumptions
                                    you made in your design.</p>
                            <li>
                                <p>Considered alternatives and tradeoffs. The design decision and justification must
                                    include description of considered alternatives, the tradeoffs they present, and why
                                    they were rejected. Tradeoffs must involve (but are not limited to) quality
                                    attributes that will be affected by the alternative. Justify such arguments with
                                    reference to appropriate diagrams (this provides traceability) and concrete
                                    examples, as appropriate.</p>
                        </ul>
                </ol>
                <p>On diagrams. The design document must include both diagrams and text. Diagrams should involve
                    suitable architectural views; must include a legend; and should involve appropriate levels of
                    abstraction for the components in the diagram. If necessary, use color/shape/text to differentiate
                    between types of components and connectors. You may find it appropriate to merge more than one view
                    into a single diagram. If you do this, you must be explicit about what views you are merging, and
                    why. Otherwise, diagrams should clearly represent legitimate architectural views. Make sure that
                    multiple views of the architecture are consistent with each other and the links are clear; if
                    necessary provide a mapping in additional text.</p>

                        Architectures: Views and Beyond, Second Edition</a> is a useful book on creating architecture
                    documentation. It is available (for free) as an e-book from the CMU library web site. If you use it,
                    treat it as reference material; do not plan to read major parts of it.</p>
                <p>Drawing diagrams is easier with the right software. Consider tools like draw.io (free, online, and
                    collaborative), Dia, OmniGraffle, MS Visio, or even just the drawing editor of Google Docs. Google
                    Slides will also likely work for this purpose. Pictures of whiteboard drawings are also acceptable,
                    if clearly readable.</p>
                <p>Additional Hints:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>The design document task is easy to underestimate both in terms of time needed and in terms
                            of difficulty designing meaningful and useful descriptions. While it is easy to create a
                            superficial solution, a good solution will likely require significant thinking, discussion,
                            and iteration. Feel free to seek feedback from the course staff on your solution before
                            submission.</p>
                    <li>
                        <p>It may take several iterations to get your architectural views right. Appoint someone to
                            track the accuracy and completeness of architectural representations throughout this
                            assignment. Do not just divide up the views among your team members and assume they show
                            everything needed. You only need to submit the final designs/documents, not intermediate
                            steps on the process of getting there.</p>

                <p><strong>This is an individual component.</strong></p>
                <p>Note: this is not an open-ended reflection document like those we have requested in previous
                    assignments. You must engage with the ethical questions at hand.</p>
                <p>For this deliverable, we will ask you to think about potential ethical concerns with the technology
                    that you are proposing to implement. You should consider the ethical implications from the
                    perspective of all potential stakeholders. You might find it helpful to consider the questions we
                    considered in class:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>Does the software respect the humanity of the users?</p>
                    <li>
                        <p>Does my software amplify positive behavior, or negative behavior for both users and society
                            at large</p>
                    <li>
                        <p>Could the software’s quality impact the humanity of others?</p>
                </ol>
                <p>You should generate a list of potential ethical concerns for this system you are considering
                    implementing.</p>
                <p>For each concern, you should assess the risk of that concern (Remember risk is how likely it is to
                    happen, and how bad would the outcomes be).</p>
                <p>After assessing the risk, you should consider ways to address the ethical concern. For each concern,
                    you should consider potential actions that could help address this concern, and safeguard against
                    potential problems.</p>
                <p>The deliverable for this task is a document (soft limit 3 pages), submitted to Gradescope that:</p>
                <ul>

                <p>To receive full credit on the design document, we expect:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>A concise, accurate feature description.</p>
                    <li>
                        <p>A list of the quality requirements you considered, ranked in decreasing order of importance.
                        </p>
                    <li>
                        <p>Appropriate use of at least two diagrams to support your design argument.</p>
                    <li>
                        <p>A clear decision with an accurate description of how you think the feature should be
                            integrated into the current system (diagrams and text). Someone else should be able to read
                            this description and understand where to start, implementation-wise. Do not say only “If X,
                            then I’d choose design #1; otherwise, I’d choose design #2.” In the real world, decisions
                            must be made on the basis of incomplete information, with an understanding that sometimes
                            the wrong decision gets made. You can say what information you wish you had in order to
                            better-inform your decision.</p>
                    <li>
                        <p>A good, substantive argument in favor of the design choice you made. This must include
                            explicit description and consideration of alternatives, the substantiated (connected to
                            quality attributes and other concerns) tradeoffs they afford, and reasons that you decided
                            to reject them. These should be supported with technical arguments.</p>
                    <li>
                        <p>A thorough discussion of the tradeoffs among the options. If there are any situations in
                            which your choice was the wrong one, what would those situations look like, and how would
                            you know (after the fact) that this was the case?</p>
                </ul>
                <p>To receive full credit on the individual ethical reflection, we expect:</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>A discussion of ethical concerns that considers a wide variety of stakeholders</p>
                    <li>
                        <p>That you can reason about potential ethical concerns before the emerge</p>
                    <li>
