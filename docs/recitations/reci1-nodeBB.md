# Recitation 1: Understand NodeBB (Asynchronous) + Installation of NodeBB (Optional) - DUE Friday January 16th, 11:59pm
### NOTE: because this recitation falls before the first day of class, it will be asynchronous.  You will complete online, and not attend recitation in person until January 26th (January 19th is MLK Jr. day). HOWEVER, if you want to start and get some help with [Project 1A: Build Checkpoint](https://cmu-313.github.io/projects/P1/), there will be Office Hours held by TAs during recitation times.

## Overview

In this course, we will be building on a piece of open source software, [NodeBB](https://nodebb.org/). NodeBB is "an innovative forum software designed to meet the needs of modern online communities."

We will be using NodeBB for the majority of the semester, and we want to start by having you become familiar with the software. 

You can find an instance of the software deployed at: [Class NodeBB](http://17313-nodebb.s3d.cmu.edu/)

To help yourself become more familiar with the site, we will ask you to interact with it in several ways. 

## Activity 1: Create an account

Create a user account using your Andrew ID as the username. You must use your Andrew ID for us to be able to identify you for assigning participation points. You can then edit your profile to add a "Full Name" and a profile picture. Note that the demo site does not have the ability to send emails of any kind, so please remember your password as it cannot be easily reset.

## Activity 2: Introduce yourself 
You should introduce yourself to the rest of the class. Please create a post in the "Introductions" category, which is only visible once you login (see note at the bottom of this page). You should include in your introduction the following info:

- What you want to be called
- A picture of you (ideally something that will help people recognize you when they see you in class) in the "thumbnail" of the post.
- A short description (1-3 sentences) about a software project you have enjoyed working on in the past, e.g. during an internship or a large-ish course project. 
- A short summary of why you're taking this course (e.g., because it is a requirement for a specific program, because you hope to learn about X, etc.).
- Something that you like to do outside of work, or your favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. Feel free to embed photos or links in the post.

## Activity 3: Reply to another post
After you have introduced yourself, you should reply to at least one other introduction post made by someone else, and comment on or ask a specific question about their prior experience or personal hobby. Try using the "quote reply" feature (look for the double-quotation marks at the bottom-right of a post) to reply to a specific sentence from their post.

## Activity 4: Follow up

Login again after a few hours to see if anyone has responded to your Introduction post, and answer their questions, if any.


!!! note Introductions are not public
    The "Introductions" category is configured so that it will not be indexed by search engines, etc. and are only visible to logged-in users.
