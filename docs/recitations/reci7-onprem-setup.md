# Recitation 7: Linux VM Setup

Although not discussed in the last recitation, another common method for deploying services is on-premises infrastructure, which is widely utilized by large corporations, particularly in the finance industry. Unlike Vercel, which specializes in cloud-based deployment and offers streamlined solutions for web applications, typically on-premises deployment provides organizations with greater control over their hardware, data security, and compliance requirements, albeit at the cost of higher maintenance and upfront investment.

Emails were sent out to each group with instructions on how to connect to their VM. Only one person per group needs to setup the hosted group instance and everyone will have access to the VM and resource. The purpose of this recitation is to help you and your team host NodeBB on your Linux VM for use in Project 3 where you will be integrating CI/CD tools into development practice.

Today, we will be walking through setting up your team's NodeBB instance on an On Premises Deployment (hosted at CMU). Since each group will be working to set up one instance, make sure to help one person on each team go through the setup step by step. Make sure to follow along through each line on the slides/document presented here:

Make sure to [Submit on Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/1086939/assignments/6968272/submissions) after this recitation. There should be one hosted instance per group but each team member should make a submission onto Gradescope.
