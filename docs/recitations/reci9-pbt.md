# Recitation 9: Property-Based Testing

## Overview

In lecture, we covered property-based testing.

In this recitation, you will practice how to apply property-based testing to an actual codebase.

Specifically, you will continue to work with [PierogIO](https://github.com/CMU-313/PierogIO), the fictional pierogi delivery service for which you wrote example-based tests in lecture last week.
The codebase is riddled with issues!
You will work in your **project teams** to write effective property-based tests, find bugs, and fix them.
I.e., you will use property-based testing to go on a bug hunt.
A small prize will be awarded to the team that finds the most bugs (using property-based tests) at the start of lecture on Thursday.

## Setup

1.  **One person in your team** should go to the PierogIO repository and click the "Use this template" button in the top right corner before selecting the "Create repository" option, as shown below.

    ![Use the PierogIO repo as a template for your team's repository](/assets/images/reci/template-create-repo.png)

    That person should then choose to create a **private repository**, select "CMU-313" as the owner, and name it "pierogio-**your-team-name**" before hitting the "Create repository" button.

2.  After creating the repository, that person should **invite the rest of the team as collaborators.**
    To do so, go to the **Settings** page for your repository, then select **"Collaborators and teams"** from the menu on the left.
    You can then either click the **Add team** button and type in / select your team, or you can click **Add people** and manually add the rest of your team to the repository.

3.  Finally, everyone should be able to access the repository.
    You can then use Codespaces to open up the repository or you can clone it to your machine and install it as a DevContainer (CMD+SHIFT+P: "Rebuild and Reopen in Dev Container").
    You should now be able to interact with the codebase.

    !!! info "Codespaces is just an IDE in the Cloud"
        Be aware that any changes you make within the Codespace won't be saved to GitHub unless and until you push your changes.
        Similarly, you won't see any changes that your team members make until you pull those changes.

## Activity

TODO: describe the bug hunt here

## Submission

TODO: ask students to submit some artifact to Gradescope before the end of recitation.
It could be a very short quiz.
