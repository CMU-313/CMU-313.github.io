# Recitation 8: Large Language Models

## Overview 

During this recitation, you will be able to run and evaluate a large language model on an example question/answer dataset. This is an individual activity so everyone should be running the notebook; however, feel free to discuss the activity and your approach with other students!

## Instructions
For this recitation and Project 4, you'll be using the OpenAI Platform in a Colab notebook to query a large language model on a question/answer dataset. First, we need to create a copy of the Colab notebook. Note: get your OpenAI keys from [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DcccXconWc_fzphMXGxYyK9zK2s_KEgaYtSCa0ZiiKo/edit?usp=sharing)

1.  Open the Colab notebook using [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FO1DWbkKPCdafYAE2Gvq2fs7VSliKior?usp=sharing). Click on File --> Save as a copy in Drive to create your own copy that you will work on.

2.  Click on Share and make sure the Colab notebook is editable by anyone in Carnegie Mellon University. You will submit a link to this notebook for Gradescope.

3. Have fun with the activity!

Once you are done, submit the link to your Colab notebook and the answers to the question in Gradescope at [this link](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/942846/assignments/5920526).
