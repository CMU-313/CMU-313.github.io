# Recitation 7: Azure Setup

As discussed in last recitation, [Microsoft Azure](azure.com) is another cloud deloyment software similar to Vercel which you all have used in class before. We will be giving out access to Microsoft credits to each team. Only one person per group needs to setup the group Azure instance but everyone will have access to the shared resource. The purpose of this recitation is to help you and your team setup Azure for use in Project 3 where you will be integrating CI/CD tools into development practice.

Today, we will be walking through setting up your team's NodeBB instance on [Azure](https://portal.azure.com/#home). Since each group will be working to set up one instance, make sure to help one person on each team go through the setup step by step. Make sure to follow along on the slides and document presented here:

Make sure to [Submit on Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/835182/assignments/5165038) after this recitation. There should be one Azure instance
per group but each team member should make a submission onto Gradescope.
