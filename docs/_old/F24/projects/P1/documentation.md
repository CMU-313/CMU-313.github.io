We also have a [simple Git-based exercise](/projects/P1/github) that you are highly recommeneded to complete before proceeding with this project.

## NodeBB Documentation

The official NodeBB documentation is available at https://docs.nodebb.org. The CMU-313 snapshot is a fork of v3.8.4.

When developing with NodeBB, the following documentation about internal REST API endpoints might be helpful:

- [Read API](https://docs.nodebb.org/api/read/)
- [Write API](https://docs.nodebb.org/api/write/)

If you want to run HTTP requests to interact with the REST API of a running NodeBB instance (e.g., on `localhost`), then you can use the `curl` tool to issue HTTP requests via the command-line.
