# Project 1A: Build Checkpoint
## Prerequisites
### Onboarding Materials
Before jumping into the codebase, please review the [course syllabus](/syllabus) and be sure you have access to each of the following:

- Course Slack - check your email for an invite link
- [Canvas](https://canvas.cmu.edu/courses/36599)
- [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/583198)

If you run into any trouble accessing the above or have any questions, reach out to the instructors.

### Git & GitHub
In this project and throughout the rest of this course, you will be expected to work extensively with Git and GitHub. Specifically for this project, you should be familiar with:

- [x] Forking/cloning GitHub repositories
- [x] Understanding general Git flow - pulling, branching, adding, committing, pushing, merging
- [x] Creating GitHub Issues and using related features (labels, assignees, milestones)
- [x] Creating GitHub Pull Requests and using related features (linking to issues)
- [x] Creating GitHub Project Boards

If you are not familiar with any of these steps, you are **highly recommended** to first complete a short [Github Exercise](/projects/P1/github), as it will cover the standards we are expecting in this class (which you will be graded upon). Refer to the [Resources & Documentation](#git--github-documentation) section if needed.

## Getting Started

### Repository Setup
Fork the [class-specific repository](https://github.com/CMU-313/NodeBB) into your personal GitHub account.

!!! warning
	Even though this project is based off of an active open source project, we have made significant changes to ensure its suitability for our class. As such, be sure you are forking off of **CMU-313/NodeBB** and direct any questions to course staff. Do **not** contact the maintainers of NodeBB for assistance with your homework questions.

Ensure that GitHub Actions are enabled (click the green button under the "Actions" tab), then follow the below installation instructions based on your computer's operating system:

- [Mac](/projects/P1/installation/mac/)
- [Windows](/projects/P1/installation/windows/)
- [Ubuntu (Linux)](/projects/P1/installation/ubuntu/)

Once you have run NodeBB successfully, you should be able to navigate to [http://localhost:4567](http://localhost:4567) and see the main forum page. By default, NodeBB will be deployed to port `4567` on your machine. You may change this port number (e.g. to avoid conflict with another process running on your machine).

!!! warning
	In this class, we do expect students to first try debugging errors on their own; this includes following stack traces, searching up error strings and unfamiliar outputs, etc. If you do get stuck, or if the process of installing and running NodeBB is taking you more than a few hours, **stop** and ask for help on Slack!

Take some time to click through the pages and explore the different features that NodeBB has to offer.

### Analysis Tools
When working on an existing codebase, especially in a collaborative setting, we want to ensure that none of our changes introduce unexpected bugs or issues for other developers. To fulfill these goals, we often use different tools to help us evaluate our code. Luckily, NodeBB is already packaged with a number of neat tools!

Follow the **Development Tools** section in the repository README to run both the linter and testing tools provided by NodeBB on your computer. Without any changes to the repository, both tools should pass. 

After the test suite finishes running, NodeBB will also generate a **code coverage report**. This report gives you measurements with regards to what percentage of the codebase is covered by the test suite. Open the `index.html` file in the `coverage` folder to see the full report.

!!! note "Coverage Report"
	As this is an existing codebase with a decently-sized test suite, you should expect to see a relatively **high percentage of coverage**, i.e. the majority of the bars/cells displayed should be green.

	If you are seeing **a lot** of red bars, it may mean that the test suite was not run properly. Double-check that all of the tests passed and that there were no failures.

??? info "More on Analysis Tools"
	A **linter** is a tool that directly analyzes your source code for common errors. A **test suite** is a set of test cases that you write for a software program to show that it has some specified set of behaviors; our **testing tool** provides a framework to structure our test cases, runs the test suite, and generates a report of which tests pass/fail.

	We will do a more in-depth exploration of analysis tools later in the course. For now, just know that these tools exist for you to use in evaluating your code.

### Build Checkpoint (5 pts)
Upon completing the above steps, take screenshots of

- the home page of NodeBB, and
- the coverage report generated by the coverage tool

opened in your browser. **Be sure the URL is clearly visible in both screenshots** (i.e. `localhost:4567` and the file path to your coverage file), so we can confirm that you have everything running locally.

Submit the two screenshots to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/583198).

## Grading
To receive full credit for this checkpoint, we expect:

- [ ] A Gradescope submission of two screenshots showing a local running build of NodeBB and the coverage report within a browser
