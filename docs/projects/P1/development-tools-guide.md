## Core Technologies

### **Docker** üê≥

**What it is**: Docker creates "containers" - lightweight, portable environments that package your application with all its dependencies.

**Think of it like**: Shipping containers that work the same way on any truck, train, or ship. A Docker container runs the same way on any computer.

**Why we use it**: 
- **Consistency**: Everyone runs the exact same environment
- **Isolation**: Your project won't conflict with other software on your machine
- **Reproducibility**: Eliminates "it works on my machine" problems
- **Easy setup**: Pre-configured with all necessary tools

**Example**: Instead of manually installing Node.js, Redis, and configuring everything, Docker gives you a pre-built environment ready to go.

---

### **Dev Containers** üì¶

**What it is**: A VS Code extension that uses Docker to create development environments automatically.

**How it works**: When you open a project with a `.devcontainer` folder, VS Code asks if you want to "Reopen in Container" - this builds and launches a Docker container with all development tools pre-installed.

**Benefits**:
- **Zero manual setup**: No need to install Node.js, databases, or other dependencies
- **Identical environments**: Everyone in the class has the exact same setup
- **Fast onboarding**: Get coding in minutes, not hours
- **Consistent experience**: Course staff can better help you since we all use the same environment

**Workflow**: 
1. Clone repository ‚Üí 2. Open in VS Code ‚Üí 3. Click "Reopen in Container" ‚Üí 4. Start coding!

---

### **VS Code** üíª

**What it is**: A popular code editor (like Microsoft Word, but designed for writing code).

**Key features**:
- **Syntax highlighting**: Colors code to make it easier to read
- **IntelliSense**: Auto-completion and error detection
- **Integrated terminal**: Command line built right into the editor
- **Extensions**: Add functionality like Dev Containers, Git tools, etc.
- **Debugging**: Step through code to find and fix bugs

**Why developers love it**: Free, fast, powerful, and works with almost any programming language.

---

## NodeBB & Web Development

### **NodeBB** üó£Ô∏è

**What it is**: Forum software (like Reddit, Discord, or traditional bulletin boards) built for modern web browsers.

**Key features**:
- **Real-time messaging**: Updates appear instantly without page refreshes
- **User accounts**: Registration, profiles, permissions
- **Categories & topics**: Organized discussion threads
- **Responsive design**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Plugin system**: Extensible with third-party add-ons

**Built with**: Node.js, Express.js, WebSockets, and either Redis, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL

**Why we chose it**: Real-world, actively maintained project with complex features that demonstrate software engineering challenges.

---

### **Node.js & npm** üì¶

**Node.js**: JavaScript runtime that lets you run JavaScript on servers (not just in web browsers).

- **Traditional**: JavaScript only ran in browsers
- **Node.js**: JavaScript can now power servers, build tools, and desktop applications

**npm (Node Package Manager)**: Like an "app store" for JavaScript code libraries.

**Common commands**:
- `npm install` - Downloads all packages your project needs
- `npm run [script]` - Runs predefined commands (like `npm run test`)
- `npm start` - Typically starts your application

**Package.json**: File that lists what packages your project depends on, like a shopping list for npm.

---

### **Localhost & Ports** üè†

**Localhost**: Your own computer acting as a web server.

- `http://localhost:4567` means "show me the website running on my computer, port 4567"
- **Port numbers**: Like apartment numbers - different services use different ports
- **Port 4567**: NodeBB's default port (you can change this if needed)

**Why localhost**: Lets you test your application privately before sharing it with the world.

---

## Quality Assurance Tools

### **Linting** (`npm run lint`) ‚úÖ

**What it is**: A tool that analyzes your code for style issues and potential errors.

**Like**: Grammar and spell-check for code.

**What it catches**:
- Missing semicolons
- Unused variables  
- Inconsistent formatting (spaces vs tabs)
- Potential logic errors
- Style guide violations

**Example**: 
```javascript
// Linter would flag these issues:
var unusedVariable = 'hello'  // unused variable
console.log( 'world' )        // inconsistent spacing
```

**Why important**: Keeps code clean, readable, and consistent across team members.

---

### **Testing** (`npm run test`) üß™

**What it is**: Automated checks that verify your code works correctly.

**Types**:
- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions in isolation
- **Integration tests**: Test how different parts work together
- **End-to-end tests**: Test the entire application flow

**Example**:
```javascript
// A simple test
test('addition works correctly', () => {
  expect(2 + 2).toBe(4);
});
```

**Why crucial**: 
- **Catch bugs early**: Before users encounter them
- **Prevent regressions**: Ensure new changes don't break existing features
- **Enable refactoring**: Safely improve code knowing tests will catch mistakes

---

### **Code Coverage** üìä

**What it is**: Measurement of what percentage of your code is executed by tests.

**Coverage report**: Visual display showing:
- **Green lines**: Covered by tests  
- **Red lines**: Not covered by tests
- **Percentage**: Overall coverage score

**Good coverage**: Generally 70-90% for most projects (NodeBB should show high coverage).

**Why it matters**: Higher coverage = more confidence that your code works correctly.

**Important note**: 100% coverage doesn't mean perfect code - quality of tests matters more than quantity.

---

## Development Workflow Concepts

### **Version Control (Git)** üìÅ

**Git**: Tool that tracks changes to files over time, like a "save game" system for code.

**Key concepts**:
- **Repository (repo)**: Folder containing all project files + change history
- **Commit**: Snapshot of your code at a specific point in time
- **Branch**: Parallel version of your code for working on features
- **Merge**: Combining changes from different branches

**GitHub**: Website that hosts Git repositories online and adds collaboration features.

!!! info "Detailed Git Commands"
    For a comprehensive reference of Git commands specific to this project, see our [Git Commands Reference Guide](git-commands-reference.md).

---

### **Forking & Cloning** üç¥

**Forking**: Making your own copy of someone else's repository on GitHub.
- Original repo ‚Üí Fork to your account ‚Üí You can make changes safely

**Cloning**: Downloading a repository from GitHub to your computer.
- `git clone <url>` downloads the code so you can work on it locally

**Why fork first**: So you can make changes without affecting the original project.

---

### **Development Environment vs Production** üèóÔ∏è

**Development environment**: 
- Where you write and test code
- Usually on `localhost`
- Can break things safely
- Has debugging tools enabled

**Production environment**: 
- Where real users access your application
- Public website with real domain name
- Must be stable and fast
- Has monitoring and security features

**Why separate**: You can experiment and make mistakes in development without affecting real users.

---

## Modern Development Practices

### **Containerization Benefits** üì¶

**Traditional development problems**:
- "It works on my machine" syndrome
- Hours spent configuring environments
- Version conflicts between projects
- Difficult to onboard new team members

**Container solutions**:
- **Consistency**: Same environment for everyone
- **Isolation**: Projects don't interfere with each other
- **Portability**: Works on Windows, Mac, Linux
- **Quick setup**: Ready to code in minutes

---

### **Automated Quality Checks** ‚úÖ

**Why automate**:
- **Consistency**: Tools don't have "off days" like humans
- **Speed**: Check entire codebase in seconds
- **Catch issues early**: Before they become expensive to fix
- **Enable collaboration**: Maintain code quality as team grows

**Industry standard**: Most professional projects use linting, testing, and continuous integration.

---

### **Real-time Development** ‚ö°

**Hot reload**: Changes appear in browser automatically when you save files.

**Live debugging**: See errors and logs in real-time.

**Instant feedback**: Know immediately if something breaks.

**Why it matters**: Faster development cycle means more time for building features, less time waiting.

---

## Common Troubleshooting

### **Container Issues**

**Problem**: "Reopen in Container" option doesn't appear
**Solution**: Ensure `.devcontainer` folder is at project root level

**Problem**: Container build fails
**Solution**: Check Docker is running, try "Dev Containers: Rebuild Container"

---

### **Port Conflicts**

**Problem**: `localhost:4567` doesn't work
**Solutions**: 
- Check NodeBB is running (`./nodebb start`)
- Try different port in VS Code Ports tab
- Restart container if ports are conflicted

---

### **Test/Lint Failures**

**Problem**: Tests fail on first run
**Solution**: Run `npm install` to fetch dependencies, check `config.json` setup

**Problem**: Linter shows many errors
**Solution**: This is normal for learning - fix one error at a time, ask for help if overwhelmed

---
