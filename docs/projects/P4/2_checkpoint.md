# Final (Implementation and Evaluation)

## Final LLM Experiment Implementation (30 points)

The final step is to implement this LLM feature into your team's NodeBB project. Your implementation should include the UI code you integrated in Checkpoint #1. You should also integrate the code you developed as a part of the LLM experiment, but you may modify it as needed to successfully integrate the functionality into your code.
**Because this is the last Project to use NodeBB, commit to your repo, and we will grade your final repository state**!

Reach out to your TA if you have any questions. 

## Individual Reflection (30 points)

Each student will be responsible for answering individual reflection questions on Gradescope.  This will include questions about what tasks you took on, what you learned, challenges you encountered, as well as describing your contributions and your perspective about the contributions of your teammates.  **Each student will be responsible for submitting their own reflection.** 

The reflection will be a series of questions answered on Gradescope.


## Grading
To receive full credit for the final deadline, we expect:

- [ ] A functional translation feature, as described in your design document, integrated into your NodeBB application.
- [ ] Answering questions on Gradescope reflecting on your learning and teamwork experiences during P4.
