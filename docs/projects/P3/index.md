# Project 3: Continuous Integration + Deployment

## Learning Goals

- Learn how to deploy a full-stack application
- Gain hands-on experience with analysis tools, including setting up, customizing, and using them
- Practically assess and compare the costs and benefits of existing static and dynamic bug-finding tools
- Integrate CI/CD tools into development practice

## Project Context

Adding continuous integration for quality assurance is a critical part of software development. Although you have been testing your new system this whole time, you are now setting out to establish sustained practices that can be used moving forward as you iterate over and continue to improve your system.

Your manager has assigned you two major tasks. Firstly, establishing a deployment pipeline to create a test version of the website that can be sent to beta testers who have little to no experience with code development (and therefore can not set up the developer environment by themselves).

Secondly, evaluating existing tools and practices beyond simple linting or unit testing, then producing a report on the cost/benefit tradeoffs and risks of them. You will also select and integrate one (or more!) of these tools into your development process.
